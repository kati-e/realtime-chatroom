I made a real-time chat web application using React & Firebase!
This was my first experience using Firebase and using auth.

I did:

- Auth & Login with Google Account
- Realtime update when new message sent
- Checking user id to swap styling depending on what you 'received' and what you 'sent'

The base of this app was made through watching this tutorial by Fireship on YT --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88
Then I expanded the rest from there myself.

Thank you~
